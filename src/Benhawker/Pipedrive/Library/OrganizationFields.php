/**
 * Pipedrive Deals Methods
 *
 * DealFields represent the near-complete schema for a Deal in the context of the company of the authorized user.
 * Each company can have a different schema for their Deals, with various custom fields. In the context of using
 * DealFiels as a schema for defining the data fields of a Deal, it must be kept in mind that some types of
 * custom fields can have additional data fields which are not separate DealFields per se. Such is the case with
 * monetary, daterange and timerange fields â€“ each of these fields will have one additional data field in addition
 * to the one presented in the context of DealFields. For example, if there is a monetary field with the key
 * 'ffk9s9' stored on the account, 'ffk9s9' would hold the numeric value of the field, and 'ffk9s9_currency'
 * would hold the ISO currency code that goes along with the numeric value. To find out which data fields are
 * available, fetch one Deal and list its keys.
